# README

This repository contains the dataflows, infiles, and scripts I used in the paper Porter and Hajibabaei, 2021 "Profile hidden Markov model sequence analysis can help remove putative pseudogenes from DNA barcoding and metabarcoding datasets".

Infiles and scripts can be downloaded from https://github.com/terrimporter/PorterHajibabaei2021_pseudogene/releases .
